# 👤 Face Detection & Recognition using OpenCV (Python)

A Python-based computer vision project that leverages **OpenCV** to detect and recognize human faces from both static images and real-time video streams (webcam).

This project uses OpenCV’s **pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier** for fast and efficient face detection and is designed to be simple, customizable, and beginner-friendly.
